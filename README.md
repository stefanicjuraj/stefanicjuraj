## Juraj Štefanić

I am a Bachelor of Science (bacc.ing.techn.inf.) in Information Technology / Web & Mobile Computing from Rochester Institute of Technology.

With an interest and previous work experiences in `software development`, `software documentation (technical writing)`, `data engineering`, and `user experience & user interface (UX/UI)`; learning and hobby projects I occupy my time with are an outlet for my creativity and serve a great learning curve.

The next chapter is to apply the skills and knowledge I have acquired to make a meaningful impact in my work experience, contributing to open source projects, and continuing to create my own.
